This Ace of Spades' first appearance was in an issue of the self-titled 'Joker' series.[1] He became the leader of the Royal Flush Gang after Amos Fortune, the Ace of Clubs, left the group. After being defeated by the Joker, the team disbanded again for a while; however, they returned for a later battle with Wonder Woman. The true identity of this Ace of Spades was never made known.
Android

A superstrong android first appeared as the part of the second version of the Royal Flush Gang led by Hector Hammond.[2] He was created by Derek Reston and occasionally impersonated him. He has been destroyed several times, but is usually re-built.
Amos Fortune

Amos Fortune became the third Ace of Spades and led the second, Hammond-formed RFG for a battle with the Justice League Detroit and his former childhood comrades, who had re-grouped without him. They were all defeated, and since then, Fortune has remained apart from any RFG reunions to menace the League on his own.
Ernie Clay

The fourth Ace was a petty criminal by the name of Ernie Clay. An associate of Joe Carny, the former King of the second Royal Flush Gang, Clay replaced the "Derek Reston" android as the Ace when the second Gambler re-formed and re-equipped the Gang. He was outfitted with a powered exo-skeleton to give him super strength.[3]
Keonton

The fifth Ace of Spades is a Hispanic male who was recruited by Lex Luthor to join the most recent incarnation of the RFG, which was in turn a part of the Secret Society of Super-Villains, during the Infinite Crisis. The team was sent to menace the new Firestorm (Jason Rusch) but was defeated; however, they escaped capture and are presumably still at large.

Others

Since the Infinite Crisis, two more editions of the Royal Flush Gang have come into existence, each with its own new Ace of Spades. Nothing has as yet been revealed about either of these Aces.
